    product_info:
      "All IRVINS Salted Egg snacks are chef-crafted in small batches, using whole food ingredients including real salted egg (brined for 30 days!), aromatic curry leaves, and bird's eye chili pepper for a tiny hint of heat. Each ingredient is literally baked into our chips in small batches. (Not like other mass produced snacks, which simply 'spray' artificial powders and flavorings down an assembly line). This unique, time-intensive process is what makes our premium snacks so Dangerously Addictive, and it's why we are Singapore's #1 snack. PS - Be sure to give your bag a good shake to evenly distribute all the salted egg goodness!",
