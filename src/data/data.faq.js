    title: "ARE YOUR SNACK VEGETARIAN OR VEGEN ?",
    text: "If you'll notice in our pictures, our chips are actually purposefully in those bits because we lovingly hand-mix our chips with real salted egg and other chef-crafted ingredients, then bake them right into the chip (as opposed to other brands who just 'spray' a powdered flavoring onto the chip). This extra special care into flavoring our chips is what makes IRVINS so #DangerouslyAddictive. In fact, we even recommend you give your bag an extra good shake to properly distribute all the salted egg goodness before you dig in.",
