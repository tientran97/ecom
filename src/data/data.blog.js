A definite go-to fan favorite when it comes to an IRVINS product. Bringing our love for fish to another level, IRVINS has launched Salmon Skin in March, and it has been well-loved by many since then.",
    text_2:
      "To know more about Salmon Skin, let's start with finding out the difference between fish skin and salmon skin. Some of you might have not known the origins of Fish Skin. As we‚Äôve explained in our IRV Files here; Our Fish Skin comes from a species of fish called the Pangasius. They‚Äôre one of the most common fish that we consume. The pangasius fishes are caught and we upcycle the fish skin into fried fish skin you find in our products.",
    text_3:
      "We‚Äôre sure you know the health benefits that come with consuming salmon. Other than being a dish for meals, we can have them as a snack to curb those munchies. As you know, the skin of the salmon is often removed before being served in dishes such as eggs royale and sushi. We‚Äôre here to upcycling the skin and produce them as amazing snacks such as the Salted Egg Salmon Skin or the Hot Boom Salmon Skin.",
    text_4:
      "There are many benefits to Salmon as well. It is known to have a good source of protein as well as being rich in Omega-3 as well. Proteins are able to help our body in healing and also maintaining muscle mass during weight loss. To top off the richness in protein, salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This helps increase blood flow, lowers blood pressure and even decreases inflammation!",

      "Definitely a bonus for beauty enthusiasts, Salmon is packed with marine collagen. They are there to help improve and maintain the condition of your skin, hair, nails and even bones much quicker than your normal collagen.",

      "Here‚Äôs the biggest question from anyone that is new to our snacks. What is Salted Egg? We‚Äôre here to debunk this mysterious Asian flavour that not everyone would know about. For a quick introduction, the salted duck egg is commonly found in Asian cuisines. Now let‚Äôs delve into the wondrous world of Salted Egg!",
    text_2:
      "The journey starts off with acquiring Fresh Duck Eggs from a particular species called the Khaki Campbell. The ducks are all from a free range duck farm that has undergone all the proper legislation. Our supplier ensures that the fresh eggs are hatched from the hatchery.",
    text_3:
      "The fresh duck eggs would then undergo the process of Brining. Brining is the process where the duck eggs are preserved in salted soil for about 25 to 30 days under ambient condition. From these brined eggs, we would use the salted egg yolks for our salted egg flavour.",
    text_4:
      "What makes our salted egg flavour premium? We source and use the highest quality salted eggs whilst sorting and checking the parameters stringently before using the eggs. Our production and QAQC teams reject any salted egg pieces or batches that do not meet our strict parameters. As seen in the process, we use real salted eggs instead of salted egg powders (processed + added mixed seasoning).",
    text_5:
      "Why are our snacks priced the way they are? Mass brands that are able to sell products at a cheaper and affordable price, often use flavourings and other substitutes. More so, their snacks often contain traces or no salted egg content at all. At IRVINS, we use frozen salted egg yolks which derive from fresh duck eggs that are transported under a stringent cold chain. Our salted egg yolks are a dark, shiny orange colour and of consistent size throughout.",

      "As you all know, we first started in 2008 at IRVINS Seafood Restaurant on River Valley Road. Our restaurant was most famously known for its affordable crabs - especially the signature Salted Egg Crab.The restaurant relocated to a larger dining space but the struggle to keep up with the business was taking its toll and soon our founders saw an opportunity to create something new and exciting - transforming their salted egg dishes into addictive snacks.You‚Äôve always been curious on how our #DangerouslyAddictive snacks came about. Here‚Äôs an inside scoop on How IRVINS snacks are made. Specifically, our Salted Egg Potato Chips, we‚Äôre gonna dig deep into the process from how we bring in the fresh ingredients all the way through to the packing stage!",
    text_2:
      "Upon receiving the fresh raw potatoes, it all gets thoroughly washed before peeling the skin. Down the process line, the peeled potatoes are manually inspected for any discolouration.",
    text_3:
      "Here comes the fun part where we see our potatoes going through the slicing process. This is where we see the round potatoes looking more like the thin slices we get in our snack pouches. The thinly sliced potatoes will proceed to go through a very important process in which the potato slices are boiled; this process is called blanching. To explain further, Blanching is a process where the enzymes are removed along with the excess starch from the potato. This gives the potatoes that perfect golden crisp that you see in your pouches.",
    text_4:
      "The long-awaited moment, the salted egg gets mixed in alongside the freshly hand-picked curry leaves and chilli padi. This signature mixture is cooked to our potato chips, just like how it was done in the restaurant.",
    text_5:
      "This leaves us to the final step, packaging. There‚Äôs an autopack machine that would do the packing, from the insertion of nitrogen gas to ensure it maintains the quality of the chips, to the weighing and sealing of the pouches. These finished products get packed into cartons and are ready to be shipped out and delivered straight to wherever you are.",
